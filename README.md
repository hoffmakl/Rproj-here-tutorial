# Interactive code for WCM Biostatistics Computing Club RProjects/here::here() tutorial

Requires creation of an R Project (see directions in the [slides](https://github.com/hoffmakl/Rproj-here-tutorial/blob/master/MyNewConsult/Notes/Rproject_here_slides.pdf)) for code to run correctly.

MyNewConsult folder is a mock-up of what a consulting project directory might look like. It contains Code, Data, Output, Report, and Notes folders.

These codes require creation of an R Project to run. To do so, download this Github folder, open R Studio and click File -> New Project -> From an existing directory -> Browse -> <find wherever you saved this Github folder and click on the "MyNewConsult" folder> -> Create Project

MyNewConsult folder is a mock-up of what a new project directory might look like. It contains Code, Data, Output, Report, and Notes folders.

After creating the R Project, run the codes to see how `here::here()` can easily read in data, output figures and tables, and knit Rmd reports while staying organized inside the project directory folders.

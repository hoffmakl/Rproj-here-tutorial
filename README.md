# Interactive code for RProjects/here::here() tutorial

[Slides from my 2019 NYC R-Ladies Lightning Talk](https://github.com/hoffmakl/Rproj-here-tutorial/blob/master/NYC%20R-Ladies%20Lightning%20Talk.pptx)

This code requires creation of an R Project (see directions in the [slides](https://github.com/hoffmakl/Rproj-here-tutorial/blob/master/MyNewConsult/Notes/Rproject_here_slides.pdf)).

MyNewConsult folder is a mock-up of what a new project directory might look like. It contains Code, Data, Output, Report, and Notes folders.

After creating an R Project, run the codes to see how `here::here()` can easily read in data, output figures and tables, and knit Rmd reports while staying organized inside the project directory folders.
